                <p>Welcome to Budget Birdie. This is a futuristic, highly advanced technology. Bewarned - without a high level understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript, you would not be able to 
                navigate such an insanely complex webpage and its elements. Make sure that you have a PHD in software development, computer science and also an IQ of 200+.
                </p>
                <p>So basically, Budget Birdie allows you to keep track of your expenses, set a goal (monthly,weekly or daily) , and will inform you of your progress on staying under budget, 
                    and hopefully play a little celebration gif if you stay under! Very high tech stuff, please do not steal this idea as I'm sure it's very original.
                </p>
